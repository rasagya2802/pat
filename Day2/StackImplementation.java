    // Implementing a stack using an array
    // We can use an array to store the elements of the stack, and a variable to keep track of the top index of the stack.
    // Time complexity: O(1) for push and pop operations, O(n) for resizing the array when it is full.
    // Space complexity: O(n) for the array.    
    // Implementing a stack using a linked list
    // We can use a linked list to store the elements of the stack, where each node contains the value and a reference to the next node. The top of the stack is the head of the linked list.
    // Time complexity: O(1) for push and pop operations.   
    // Space complexity: O(n) for the linked list.
